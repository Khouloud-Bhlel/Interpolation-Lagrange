# GitHub Actions Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Secret Key Environment Variable Error
**Problem**: Django settings were trying to read `SECRET_KEY` from environment variables but it wasn't set in GitHub Actions.

**Solution**: 
- Added default fallback value in Django settings: `config('SECRET_KEY', default='django-insecure-fallback-key-for-development-only')`
- Added environment variables to GitHub Actions workflow steps
- Created `.env.example` file for documentation

### 2. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow
**Changes Made**:
- Added environment variables to "Run Django checks" step
- Added environment variables to "Build Project Artifacts" step
- Used temporary CI keys for testing (not for production)

## Updated Files

1. **`.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml`**
   - Added `env` blocks with required Django environment variables
   - Used CI-specific temporary secret keys

2. **`lagrange_project/settings.py`**
   - Added default fallback for `SECRET_KEY`
   - Fixed empty ALLOWED_HOSTS default

3. **`.env.example`**
   - Created example environment file
   - Documented all required environment variables

4. **`VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`**
   - Added detailed instructions for GitHub secrets
   - Added environment variables setup instructions

## Next Steps for User

### 1. Set GitHub Repository Secrets
Go to your GitHub repository settings and add these secrets:
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel API token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: team_7Ar3IoSOAiB6NEGfa8sonkCa
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: prj_rKM5tXgJXn4qJuymW8LBUpt6NcJX

### 2. Set Vercel Environment Variables
In your Vercel project dashboard, set:
- `SECRET_KEY`: Generate a secure key (use https://djecrety.ir/)
- `DEBUG`: False
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: your-app.vercel.app (replace with your actual domain)

### 3. Test the Deployment
1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub
2. The GitHub Actions workflow should trigger automatically
3. Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository for progress
4. Once deployed, check your Vercel dashboard for the live URL

## Security Notes

- The temporary secret keys used in CI are only for testing and building
- Production secret keys should be set in Vercel environment variables
- Never commit real secret keys to your repository
- The `.env.example` file shows what variables are needed but doesn't contain actual secrets
